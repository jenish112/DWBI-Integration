# DWBI-Integration

Welcome to my comprehensive project on executing a real-life Data Warehouse and Business Intelligence (DWBI) project! In this project, I'll perform complete process of loading data into Snowflake using Python, performing powerful SQL queries, and visualizing data through a dynamic PowerBI dashboard.

# Summary of Project:
- Designed ER Diagrams to map out entities and relationships foundational to a scalable data warehouse architecture.
- Implemented both Star and Snowflake Schemas to optimize query performance and ensure dimensional modeling best practices.
- Automated test data generation using Python (Faker module) to simulate realistic and large-scale datasets for fact and dimension tables.
- Configured Snowflake environment, including creation of warehouses, databases, schemas, and necessary table structures.
- Performed batch data loading into Snowflake using Python scripts, leveraging file-based ingestion techniques and Snowflake best practices.
- Developed scenario-based SQL queries to extract meaningful insights, demonstrate data transformations, and handle real-world analytical use cases.
- Applied data modeling and warehousing concepts to simulate an end-to-end BI solution pipeline.
